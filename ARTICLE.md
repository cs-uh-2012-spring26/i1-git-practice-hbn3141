The article I am sharing from Reuters is about how software companies are dropping in 
valuation recently. It explains that this is because investors have growing fears that AI
will challenge SaaS companies with potentially faster and cheaper software production.
I found this interesting as this is just another example of how AI continues to dominate conversations, 
especially concerning how much change it will bring and how it may replace existing systems. One point
I found specifically interesting, though, is that Microsoft, who "spent a record amount on AI in the
last quarter", also lost with shares declining 12.1%.
